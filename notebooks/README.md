# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.

## Best Practices

1. Use clear, descriptive naming for notebooks

   - Include date or version numbers if appropriate
   - Example: `01_data_exploration.ipynb`, `02_feature_engineering.ipynb`

2. Structure notebooks with markdown headers

   - Include a title and description at the top
   - Organize with clear section headers
   - Document your approach and findings

3. Keep notebooks focused on specific tasks

   - Split complex analyses into multiple notebooks
   - Use utility functions from the `utilities` directory for repeated code

4. Include visualizations with explanations

   - Add context to all charts and graphs
   - Explain key insights

5. Clean output before committing

   - Consider using tools like `nbstripout` to remove large outputs
   - Clear sensitive data before sharing

6. Import common dependencies at the top

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns

   # For plotting
   %matplotlib inline
   plt.style.use('ggplot')
   ```

7. Consider organizing notebooks in subdirectories for complex projects
   ```
   notebooks/
   ├── exploration/
   ├── preprocessing/
   ├── modeling/
   └── visualization/
   ```
