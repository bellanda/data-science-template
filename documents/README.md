# Documents Directory

This directory is for storing project documentation.

## Suggested Contents

- Project specifications
- Data dictionaries
- Methodology descriptions
- Technical documentation
- Business requirements
- Meeting notes
- Presentations

## Best Practices

1. Use clear naming conventions for all documents
2. Keep documentation up-to-date as the project evolves
3. Include dates in filenames or within documents for version tracking
4. For complex projects, consider organizing documents in subdirectories:
   ```
   documents/
   ├── specifications/
   ├── presentations/
   ├── reports/
   └── references/
   ```
5. Use markdown (.md) files for documentation that should be readable directly on GitHub
